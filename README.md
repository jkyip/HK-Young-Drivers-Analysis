# Statistical Analysis on the Recklessness of Young Drivers in Hong Kong

This project focuses on performing a statistical analysis of the recklessness of young drivers in Hong Kong. The main goal is to analyze driving behaviors and patterns among young drivers using data sourced from an R library. The project employs various statistical techniques, including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian Inference, to gain insights into the factors contributing to recklessness and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Files in this Repository

- `Statistical Analysis on the Recklessness of Young Drivers in Hong Kong.rmd`: This is the R Markdown file containing the main analysis. It sources data from an R library and performs various statistical techniques to explore the recklessness of young drivers.

- `Statistical Analysis on the Recklessness of Young Drivers in Hong Kong.pdf`: This PDF file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, presenting key findings from the analysis.

## Data Source

The data source for this analysis is the [Hong Kong Districts Info R Package](https://hong-kong-districts-info.github.io/hkdatasets/), which provides datasets related to Hong Kong. The relevant datasets used in this project include:
- `hk_accidents*`: A dataset containing traffic accidents between 2014 and 2019.
- `hk_casualties*`: A dataset containing information of collisions by casualties between 2014 and 2019.
- `hk_vehicles*`: A dataset containing information of vehicles by casualties between 2014 and 2019.

These datasets provide information about traffic accidents, casualties, and vehicles involved in Hong Kong, which are essential for the analysis.

## Overview

The Statistical Analysis on the Recklessness of Young Drivers in Hong Kong is a data-driven project that utilizes statistical techniques to analyze driving behaviors. The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Collection**: The relevant datasets from the Hong Kong Districts Info R Package are used to gather information about traffic accidents, casualties, and vehicles.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

3. **Descriptive Analysis**: Initial insights are gathered through descriptive statistical analysis. Summary statistics and visualizations are used to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

4. **Statistical Techniques**: Advanced statistical methods, including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian Inference, are applied to uncover patterns and relationships among young drivers' behaviors and the occurrence of accidents.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals important insights into the recklessness of young drivers in Hong Kong. By employing techniques such as MLE and Bayesian Inference, we have identified significant factors contributing to driving-related accidents. These findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions to promote safer driving habits among young drivers in the region.
